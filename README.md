# Enhancing Credit Score Prediction

This project focuses on **Credit Score Prediction** using **Random Forest Classifier** to assist financial institutions in assessing creditworthiness efficiently and accurately. By leveraging data visualization and machine learning techniques, the model classifies individuals' credit scores into three categories: **Poor**, **Standard**, and **Good**, offering valuable insights into the key factors influencing credit ratings.

## Abstract

Credit scoring is essential for financial risk management. This project employs a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict credit scores using financial and behavioral attributes like income, debt, and payment history. The results demonstrate an **accuracy of 84.14%**, and the project emphasizes key factors such as income levels, credit utilization, and payment habits.

## Features

- Predict credit scores into three categories: Poor, Standard, and Good.
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Data visualization using **box plots** for feature impact analysis.
- Performance evaluation using:
  - **Accuracy Score**
  - **Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)**
  - **Confusion Matrix**

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning.  
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.  
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization.  

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following key features:  
- **Financial Attributes**: Annual income, monthly salary, credit utilization, number of loans, etc.  
- **Behavioral Attributes**: Number of delayed payments, delay from due date, credit history age, etc.  
- **Target Variable**:  
  - 0: Poor  
  - 1: Standard  
  - 2: Good

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Handling missing values.  
   - Encoding categorical variables.  
   - Feature scaling as needed.  

2. **Model Training**:  
   - Random Forest Classifier.  
   - Train-test split for evaluation.  

3. **Visualization**:  
   - Box plots for exploring relationships between features and credit scores.  

4. **Performance Metrics**:  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.  
   - Confusion Matrix for error analysis.  

---

## Results

- **Overall Accuracy**: 84.14%  
- **Class-wise Performance**:  
  - Poor: Precision: 0.81, Recall: 0.82, F1-Score: 0.81  
  - Standard: Precision: 0.82, Recall: 0.87, F1-Score: 0.85  
  - Good: Precision: 0.87, Recall: 0.83, F1-Score: 0.85  

- **Key Insights**:  
  - Higher income and lower credit utilization generally correlate with better credit scores.  
  - Delayed payments significantly impact creditworthiness.  

---

## Future Scope

- Incorporate additional features for improved predictions.  
- Explore hybrid machine learning models.  
- Implement hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.  
- Extend the project to support real-time credit score prediction.
